    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Andrew Kyllo. I graduated with a BS in Physics from the university of Washington in 2012. My father is a highschool science and math teacher so I have a strong background in the sciences. For the last 8 years I worked as a service advisor at an Audi dealership. This was one of the most draining jobs I've had as i worked around 55 hours a week in a fast paced and high stress environment. I lived in Japan for 5 years of my younger life which provided me with a very unique and open minded approach to life. In my free time I enjoy snowboarding, hanging out with friends, and attending music festivals. In going through the Code Fellows curriculum I hope to gain the tools to join the tech workforce as a software engineer and be challenged on a daily basis.
